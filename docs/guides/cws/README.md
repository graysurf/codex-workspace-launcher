# cws / codex-workspace guide

`cws` is a small host-side wrapper that runs the `graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher` image. The launcher container
talks to your host Docker daemon (**Docker-outside-of-Docker / DooD**) and creates **workspace containers** on the
host.

This guide focuses on the end-user experience: install `cws`, create a workspace, exec into it, and clean up.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop or OrbStack (macOS)
- Ability to mount the Docker socket: `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`

## Images

The wrapper defaults to Docker Hub:

- `graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher:latest`

GHCR is also available:

- `ghcr.io/graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher:latest`

Override with `CWS_IMAGE=...`.
