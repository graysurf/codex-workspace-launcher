# `cws rm`

Removes workspace containers (and their named volumes).

## Remove one workspace

```sh
cws rm <name|container> --yes
```

## Remove all workspaces (danger)

```sh
cws rm --all --yes
```

This removes **all** containers labeled as codex workspaces on your host. Double-check with `cws ls` first.
