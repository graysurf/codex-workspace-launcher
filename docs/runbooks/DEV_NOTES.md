# Dev notes

This folder contains:

- **Runbooks**: stable, executable checklists (ex: integration testing).
- **Dev notes**: short-lived working notes for ongoing development.

Guidelines:

- Keep entries short and date-stamped.
- Prefer links to PRs, progress files, and docs.
- Do not commit large logs or temporary artifacts; store them under `$CODEX_HOME/out/` and link to the paths.
- `$CODEX_HOME/out/` is for short-term local verification and may be cleaned; for durable evidence, prefer PR
  comments and GitHub Actions run URLs.
