- Glossary: `docs/templates/PROGRESS_GLOSSARY.md`

## Addendum

- None

## Goal

- Publish a portable `graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher` image that exposes `codex-workspace create/ls/rm/exec/reset/tunnel` via `docker run`.
- Document DooD footguns (docker.sock + host-path mounts) and auth paths (`GH_TOKEN`) for macOS hosts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `docker run --rm -it graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher:latest --help` lists `create/ls/rm/exec/reset/tunnel` and exits `0`.
- With `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`, `ls`, `create graysurf/codex-kit`, `exec <name>`, and `rm <name> --yes` work end-to-end on a clean macOS host.
- With `-e GH_TOKEN="$GH_TOKEN"`, `create OWNER/PRIVATE_REPO` can clone/pull private repos (no host mounts required by default).
- `README.md` documents Quickstart, DooD rules, env vars (including deprecated), and security notes.
- CI publishes multi-arch (`linux/amd64,linux/arm64`) images with `latest` + `sha-<short>` tags.

## Scope

- In-scope:
  - `Dockerfile` + `bin/codex-workspace` wrapper to run `workspace-launcher.zsh` inside the launcher image.
  - Build args to pin `zsh-kit` and `codex-kit` refs at image build time.
  - GitHub Actions workflow for multi-arch build and publish.
  - Documentation updates in `README.md` (Quickstart, env table, security, DooD rules, examples).
  - Manual smoke commands recorded as evidence (macOS; Linux exploratory).
- Out-of-scope:
  - Modifying upstream behavior in `zsh-kit` / `codex-kit` beyond pinning refs.
  - Guaranteeing Linux host support (only smoke exploration; no support claim in docs).
  - Host-side editor integration (e.g. auto `code --new-window`) beyond documenting limitations.
  - New subcommands beyond the existing `create/ls/rm/exec/reset/tunnel` contract.

## I/O Contract

### Input

- CLI: `docker run ... graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher:<tag> <subcommand> [args]`
- Host mounts/env:
  - `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
  - optional `-e GH_TOKEN=...` (private repo cloning)
  - optional same-path host mounts (e.g. `-e HOME="$HOME" -v "$HOME/.config:$HOME/.config:ro"`)

### Output

- Host Docker side effects:
  - Workspace container(s) named with `CODEX_WORKSPACE_PREFIX` (default `codex-ws`)
  - Named volumes for workspace persistence (as created by the low-level launcher)
- CLI output for `ls/exec/rm/reset/tunnel` plus standard exit codes

### Intermediate Artifacts

- Repo files: `Dockerfile`, `bin/codex-workspace`, `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, `README.md`
- Evidence logs: `$CODEX_HOME/out/codex-workspace-launcher-smoke-*.md`

## Design / Decisions

### Rationale

- Use the existing two-layer launcher stack from `zsh-kit` (public `create/...`) and `codex-kit` (low-level `up/...`) to avoid re-implementing orchestration logic.
- Pin `zsh-kit` and `codex-kit` refs at build time to make the launcher image reproducible and reduce runtime network dependency.
- Default `CODEX_WORKSPACE_LAUNCHER` to `/opt/codex-kit/docker/codex-env/bin/codex-workspace` and prefer env-based auth (`GH_TOKEN`) inside the launcher container.

### Risks / Uncertainties

- Security: mounting `docker.sock` is root-equivalent on the host; mitigation is explicit documentation and safe defaults.
- DooD host-path resolution: any `-v <src>:<dst>` resolves on the host; mitigation is requiring absolute host paths and same-path binds.
- Token exposure: if tokens are passed into workspace containers, they may be visible via `docker inspect`; mitigation is clear docs and avoiding persistence by default.
- Multi-arch publishing: buildx/QEMU differences and runner availability; mitigation is validating on GitHub Actions and documenting known limitations.

## Steps (Checklist)

Note: Any unchecked checkbox in Step 0–3 must include a Reason (inline `Reason: ...` or a nested `- Reason: ...`) before close-progress-pr can complete. Step 4 is excluded (post-merge / wrap-up).
Note: For intentionally deferred / not-do items in Step 0–3, use `- [ ] ~~like this~~` and include `Reason:`. Unchecked and unstruck items (e.g. `- [ ] foo`) will block close-progress-pr.

- [ ] Step 0: Alignment / prerequisites
  - Work Items:
    - [ ] Confirm external CLI contract matches `workspace-launcher.zsh` help output and `docs/DESIGN.md`.
    - [ ] Decide ref pinning strategy (`ZSH_KIT_REF`, `CODEX_KIT_REF`) and default runtime image (`CODEX_ENV_IMAGE`).
    - [ ] Decide publish target(s) and tag strategy (`latest`, `sha-<short>`, optional semver).
  - Artifacts:
    - `docs/progress/20260120_portable-dood-launcher-image.md` (this file)
    - `docs/DESIGN.md` (external contract + smoke commands)
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [ ] Requirements, scope, and acceptance criteria are aligned: `docs/progress/20260120_portable-dood-launcher-image.md`.
    - [ ] Data flow and I/O contract are defined (DooD + host mounts + env): `docs/DESIGN.md`.
    - [ ] Risks and rollback plan are defined (no DB migrations): rollback = revert published tag / pin refs; risks in this file.
    - [ ] Minimal reproducible verification commands are defined:
      - `docker run --rm -it graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher:latest --help`
      - `docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher:latest ls`
      - `docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock graysurf/codex-workspace-launcher:latest create graysurf/codex-kit`
- [ ] Step 1: Minimum viable output (MVP)
  - Work Items:
    - [ ] Implement `Dockerfile` with required tooling and clone/pin `zsh-kit` + `codex-kit` into `/opt/...`.
    - [ ] Add `bin/codex-workspace` wrapper that sources `workspace-launcher.zsh` and runs `codex-workspace "$@"`.
    - [ ] Add minimal `README.md` quickstart and common commands (`--help`, `ls`, `create`).
  - Artifacts:
    - `Dockerfile`
    - `bin/codex-workspace`
    - `README.md`
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [ ] At least one happy path runs end-to-end:
      - `docker build -t codex-workspace-launcher:dev .`
      - `docker run --rm -it codex-workspace-launcher:dev --help`
      - `docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock codex-workspace-launcher:dev create graysurf/codex-kit`
    - [ ] Primary outputs are verifiable (workspace containers/volumes exist): `docker ps -a` and `docker volume ls`.
    - [ ] Usage docs skeleton exists (TL;DR + common commands + DooD rules): `README.md`.
- [ ] Step 2: Expansion / integration
  - Work Items:
    - [ ] Document and support optional host mounts (secrets/config snapshot) with same-path binds and `HOME` passthrough.
    - [ ] Document full env/flags table (including deprecated) from `docs/DESIGN.md`.
    - [ ] Validate private repo flows using `GH_TOKEN` inside the launcher container.
  - Artifacts:
    - `README.md`
    - `$CODEX_HOME/out/codex-workspace-launcher-private-repo.md`
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [ ] Common branches are covered:
      - `rm <name> --yes`, `rm --all --yes`, `reset`, `exec <name>`
      - optional mounts missing/unreadable are skipped with a clear message
    - [ ] Compatible with existing naming conventions: `CODEX_WORKSPACE_PREFIX` matches upstream behavior.
    - [ ] Required migrations / backfill scripts and documentation exist: None (no DB/migrations in this repo).
- [ ] Step 3: Validation / testing
  - Work Items:
    - [ ] Run macOS smoke suite (help, ls, create, exec, rm, reset) and capture output.
    - [ ] Run Linux exploratory smoke commands (with `--user 0:0` fallback) and capture output.
    - [ ] Verify security docs mention docker.sock risk and token visibility (`docker inspect`).
  - Artifacts:
    - `$CODEX_HOME/out/codex-workspace-launcher-smoke-macos-20260120.md`
    - `$CODEX_HOME/out/codex-workspace-launcher-smoke-linux-20260120.md`
    - CI workflow run link (once available)
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [ ] Validation commands executed with results recorded: see `$CODEX_HOME/out/codex-workspace-launcher-smoke-*.md`.
    - [ ] Run with real repos and representative samples:
      - public: `graysurf/codex-kit`
      - private: `OWNER/PRIVATE_REPO` (with `GH_TOKEN`) and rerun after any fix
    - [ ] Traceable evidence exists: smoke logs + CI run URL + published image tags.
- [ ] Step 4: Release / wrap-up
  - Work Items:
    - [ ] Add `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to buildx multi-arch and push tags on main.
    - [ ] Document tag semantics (`latest`, `sha-<short>`, optional semver) and release workflow notes.
    - [ ] Close out progress file when implementation merges (set to DONE and archive).
  - Artifacts:
    - `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
    - Published image tags and workflow run link
  - Exit Criteria:
    - [ ] Versioning and changes recorded: `latest` + `sha-<short>` (optional semver later); release notes: `README.md` (TBD if `CHANGELOG.md` is added).
    - [ ] Release actions completed: GitHub Actions publishes multi-arch images; record workflow run URL and image tags.
    - [ ] Documentation completed and entry points updated: `README.md`, `docs/progress/README.md`.
    - [ ] Cleanup completed: set this file to DONE and move to `docs/progress/archived/` when complete.
